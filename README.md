## Which files to edit in order to modify the content

Edit the `*.md` files to edit content. Edit `_include/*.html` to edit page layout and templating.


## Design decisions

- Jekyll to leverage GitHub pages
- GitHub to simplify contributions
- Separation of content (Markdown and YAML), templating (HTML and Liquid), and styling (CSS Bootstrap)
- Programmed for future reuse
- Schedule table is autogenerated from Markdown and YAML data
