## Open Call for Workshops

**Application deadline is 2016-12-14**

NeIC has an open call for hosting workshops for Nordic communities at the NeIC
2017 conference in Ume√•.

A NeIC conference workshop should have a Nordic e-infrastructure focus, and can
for example have the purpose of attracting expertise to discuss relevant topics
at hand, to explore new opportunities for Nordic collaboration, or to share
knowledge in trainings or hackathons.

The workshop tracks have been an important and very appreciated part of the
last two NeIC conferences, so for examples of workshops that the NeIC
conferences have hosted in the past please refer to previous conference
programs:

- [Program for NeIC 2013 in Trondheim, NO](https://events.nordu.net/display/NEIC13/Programme)
- [Program for NeIC 2015 in Espoo, FI](http://neic2015.nordforsk.org/display/NeIC2015/Programme)

The practicalities and expectations on a NeIC conference workshop are described
in the NeIC [conference manual](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Conference_manual).
See specifically the section on conference workshops and the responsibilities
of the workshop organizer.

Applications to NeIC to host a conference workshop are sent by the workshop
organizer to the [program committee chair](mailto:joel@nsc.liu.se).

The following workshops have been accepted for the NeIC 2017 conference:
