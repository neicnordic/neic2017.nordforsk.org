Hans Karlsson is Director of the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) and Professor in Theoretical Chemistry 
at Uppsala University. His research concerns quantum molecular dynamics with focus on developing and implementing computational 
tools and techniques for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for molecular systems. It is a cross disciplinary 
research field on the border between physical chemistry, molecular physics and scientific computing. 

Hans Karlsson was previously director for Uppsala University’s computing center SNIC-UPPMAX, 2011-2016, and Director for the 
National Graduate School of Scientific Computing (NGSSC), 2007-2012, and the Swedish e-Science Education (SeSE) 2013.
