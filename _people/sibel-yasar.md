Sibel Yasar, graduated from the TUHH (Hamburg University of Technology) with a degree in computer science. Since 2009 she is working at DESY (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron). DESY is one of the world's leading accelerator centers. Until September 2016 she developed and managed databases for the European XFEL (European x-ray free electron laser). In this role she interacted internationally with research communities and partners of the XFEL in getting data to the XFEL database. Currently she is working in the Scientific Computing group at DESY and acts as a technical liaison between the dCache group and the EGI ( European Grid Infrastructure) project. dCache is a system for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data, distributed among a large number of heterogeneous server nodes, under a single virtual filesystem tree with a variety of standard access methods.
