Innovations in microelectronics, sensor technologies and computer science have
enabled experiment designs which generate far more digital data and at a much
greater pace than ever foreseen. This session deals with on-line processing in
scientific equipment to enable greater control over experiments and better
quality data output. If you like data acquisition, triggers, filters and such,
then this session is for you.
