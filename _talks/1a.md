The Swedish Research Council (VR) is a public agency mandated by the Ministry of
Education and Research to prioritise and fund national research infrastructures
and to participate in international organisations and research infrastructures.
SNIC, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, is one of the research
infrastructures that is funded by VR. However, the use of SNICs resources has
increased dramatically which puts the e-infrastructure under pressure to deliver
services and support to a diverse scientific community as well as research
infrastructures. The questions discussed are how can VR as a funding agency help
the further development of the national e-infrastructure, SNIC? What kind of
challenges are other research infrastructures faced with that affect the
development of SNIC? How does this play into the cross-border collaborations?
