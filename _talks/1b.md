By collaborating across the borders, both geographically and scientifically, we
will have the possibility to change the world by sharing resources, knowledge
and experiences. Starting from the formulation of a new SNIC I will discuss how
we from a SNIC perspective can, and will, continue to collaborate within Sweden,
the Nordic countries, Europe and with the rest of the world.
