title: Nordic Research Infrastructure Collaboration -  a Future Success Story?
speaker: gunnel-gustafsson
session: s01
---

NordForsk is a platform for joint Nordic research and research infrastructure
cooperation. The organization was established by the Nordic Council of Ministers
in 2005. Its mandate is to respond to strategic priorities and thereby create
Nordic added value. As an introduction, there will be a presentation of how
NordForsk works and an overview of ongoing activities. Then questions are asked
about opportunities for increased Nordic research infrastructure collaboration.
Will the current successful step by step development be followed by a radical
i.e. fast and grand upgrading of Nordic cooperation in this field? What are the
forces that make such a development probable and what challenges might result in
a backlash?
