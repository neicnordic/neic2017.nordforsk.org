title: "Keynote: Crossing Boundaries, Changing Science with FAIR Data"
speaker: barend-mons

Data interoperability is hard enough within a given institute, a discipline or a
country. Here we talk about crossing boarders between disciplines, geographical
and language borders. This presentation will explain how the European Open
Science Cloud and in particular the FAIR principles and their consequent
implementation will support the ambition to cross boarders and change science in
fundamental ways to the benefit of society. Examples of how an 'Internet of FAIR
data and services' would enable Open Science globally will be discussed,
socio-cultural and technical challenges will be highlighted as well.
