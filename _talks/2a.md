speaker: antti-pursula

The Nordic countries possess wide variety of valuable individual-level data
collections in digital  form. Bringing these data collections available for
research can bring large gains for society. For example, in the medical sciences
improving the health and wellbeing of people there is  possibility to develop
individually tailored medication. On the other hand, the data collections
constitute in personal data on individuals. The challenge for e-infrastructures
is to enable utilising sensitive data for research while protecting the privacy
of individuals. 

In addition to medical science also fields such as social sciences and digital
humanities need to use personal data in the research. The sensitive data types
can range from genetics or bio sample data to interviews and video recordings,
from register data to medical health records.

NeIC and Nordic Nodes of the ELIXIR research infrastructure run the Tryggve
project that develops and provides secure e-infrastructure for sensitive data.
The project aims to enable researchers to collaborate across country and
organisational borders on sensitive data within the boundaries set by laws and
regulations. The project has been granted an extension for three more years
during which top experts are working to provide a leading sensitive data
e-infrastructure for the Nordic region.
