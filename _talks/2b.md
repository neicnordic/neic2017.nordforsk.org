The Nordic countries have a unique potential for conducting valuable health
research using the national health data sources. The existence of personal
identity numbers in combination with a high degree of public trust in research,
makes health registry research on combined large-scale datasets possible.  Use
of health data from registries in medical research is advantageous in several
ways. First, this type of data is reality based, and may be used when the
traditional randomised controlled trials are not possible. The registries are
excellent for longterm follow-up, and as they are national and mandatory, they
provide an unselected, unbiased population sample.  One of the main obstacles
for making use of this great potential is issues concerning regulations of use
of the data, and sometimes bureaucracy and legislation makes access cumbersome.
The health data should be used far more and often, and obstacles concerning
data sharing across borders must be reduced.  The society needs new knowledge,
and we must aim to conduct **more** research, provide **better** research and base the
research on real time data in order to get the results **faster**.
