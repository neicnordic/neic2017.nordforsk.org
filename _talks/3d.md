The mission of ELIXIR is to connect, integrate and sustain Europe’s life science
data. ELIXIR connects the major life-science data archives (hosted at EMBL-EBI)
with national bioinformatics infrastructures throughout ELIXIR’s member states.
By coordinating local, national and international resources – hosted at over 160
institutes - the ELIXIR infrastructure will meet the data-related needs of
Europe’s 500,000 life-scientists.

ELIXIR is a distributed infrastructure of bioinformatics services built around
established European centres of excellence. It is a permanent international
research infrastructure with 21 members (20 countries and EMBL-EBI as
international organisation).

In my talk I will give an overview of our current status, how we work to ensure
the long-term sustainability of Europe’s core life science data resources, and
how ELIXIR simplifies access to quality-controlled data, services and tools for
researchers working in all life-science disciplines.
