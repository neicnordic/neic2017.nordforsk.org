title: "NeIC: Conclusions from Workshops"
speaker: joel-hedlund
session: s04

The NeIC conference workshop tracks have been highly valued by conference goers
when we have let them evaluate their experiences from the event. For good reason!
NeIC conference workshops are prepared and attended by the most engaged experts
in the Nordic e-infrastructure communities, and have resulted in several
concrete activities being started up around the discussions therein, inside and
outside the Nordics.

This time, we are giving the workshops a time to shine also in the plenary
track, presenting their findings and results to the world!
