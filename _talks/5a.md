The quality of scientific software is critical to modern research. At the same
time scientists often lack the necessary training in practices to enable them
to collaboratively write high-quality scientific software.

The NeIC CodeRefinery project aims at providing researchers with
infrastructure, training, and guides in the necessary tools and techniques to
create sustainable, modular, reusable, and reproducible software.

In this short presentation we will discuss challenges and solutions for
training and infrastructure services to support the development of reproducible
and maintainable research software.
