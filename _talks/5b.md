title: "NLAFET: Parallel Numerical Linear Algebra for Extreme Scale Systems"
speaker: bo-kagstrom

Todayâ€™s most powerful supercomputers are composed of hundreds of thousands of
computing cores (CPUs and accelerators) connected in high speed networks that
make up a massively parallel high performance computing (HPC) system. To
effectively utilize this capacity, access to efficient and scalable parallel
algorithms and software is necessary.

NLAFET is one of the high-profile extreme-scale computing research projects
funded by the European Commission within the Future and Emerging Technologies
(FET) program under Horizon 2020. The purpose of NLAFET is to tackle these
challenges with the goal to minimizing the gap between the peak capabilities of
the hardware and the performance realized by HPC applications. Achieving this
requires a co-design effort including developing novel parallel algorithms,
exploration of advanced scheduling strategies and runtime systems, offline and
online autotuning, as well as avoiding communication and synchronization
bottlenecks. In this presentation we give an overview of the project, discuss
some of the challenges and how we are addressing them.
