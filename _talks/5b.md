The availability of low-cost hardware, high-functionality software, and the
plethora of methods for acquiring, inspecting, analyzing and sharing data has
changed the way individual researchers as well as entire communities understand
and interact with their data.  Processes that used to be hard are now trivial;
processes that used to be impossible are now necessary.  In this talk, we
describe how the commodity market for data-related services has changed the
needs of the scientific community, and how this can be leveraged in the future
to develop advanced, useful, and forward-thinking technologies to transform the
way researchers interact with data.
