title: 'Capturing the "Whole Tale" of Computational Research: Reproducibility in Computing Environments'
speaker: kyle-chard

Sharing scientific knowledge is rapidly evolving from papers and presentations
with supporting data to methods in executable form that integrate data and
knowledge (scripts, workflows, executable papers). This unification of data
with knowledge is essential to advancing science but faces deep technical and
institutional barriers. The Whole Tale project connects data-intensive research
efforts with the larger research process---transforming the knowledge discovery
and dissemination process into one where data products are united with articles
to create "living publications" (or "Tales") that exploit advanced
cyberinfrastructure and services. We focus on the full spectrum of science, from
the "long tail" at one end, to power users with high demands for access to big
data and compute resources on the other. We report here on the design and
architecture of the Whole Tale environment.
