session: s06
---

The Danish Centre for Big Data Analytics driven Innovation (DABAI) is a public
private partnership to make Denmark a pioneer in exploiting the potential of big
data. To achieve a widespread adoption of big data, it is important to have a
proper framework for collaboration between academia and industry.

This talk will present the DABAI initiative, and present some experiences from
the collaboration between several universities and a large number of companies
within areas such as food chain, education and societal challenges.
