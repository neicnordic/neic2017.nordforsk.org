## Bioethics of databanks and datasharing

Nordic committee on bioethics – workshop at the 2016 NeIC conference

New technologies enable the accumulation of large amounts of genetic data,
biometric data,  health records and socio-economic data about individuals. These
data are increasingly being gathered and mined by companies for research and
commercial purposes. The proper handling, security and use of such data is
important to protect individuals while enabling the use of the data for the
benefits of society, research or business. This workshop aims to investigate key
ethical and societal issues concerning the large-scale collection, storage and
sharing of data about individuals.

This workshop will feature presentations by invited speakers, and short summary
discussion towards the end, similar as in the
[NeIC 2015 Bioethics Workshop](http://neic2015.nordforsk.org/display/NeIC2015/Bioethics).

### Abstracts

#### Blurring boundaries in the Danish regulation and management of data sharing and new genetics

[Mette Hartlev](http://www.jur.ku.dk/medarbejdere/mettehartlev) -
Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen.

The Danish regulation of health data and biobanks, and the use of data and
tissue samples for various purposes (treatment, research, and quality control
and development), is to a large degree structured by categories and distinctions
such as treatment/research, public/private, “dry” data/tissue samples and
national/international. E.g., the relation between the researcher and the
research subject is considered to of a different kind than the doctor-patient
relationship, requiring somehow special concerns and regulation.  Similarly,
data management in the public sector is governed by principles, which differ
from those applying in the private sector. This presentation will explore how
NGS and personalized medicine challenges these distinctions and blur the
boundaries between established legal categories. It will also look into which
topics should be considered to establish a new, and robust, legal and ethical
infrastructure for data sharing in the future.
