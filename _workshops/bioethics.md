## Bioethics of Databanks and Datasharing

Nordic committee on bioethics – workshop at the 2017 NeIC conference

New technologies enable the accumulation of large amounts of genetic data,
biometric data,  health records and socio-economic data about individuals. These
data are increasingly being gathered and mined by companies for research and
commercial purposes. The proper handling, security and use of such data is
important to protect individuals while enabling the use of the data for the
benefits of society, research or business. This workshop aims to investigate key
ethical and societal issues concerning the large-scale collection, storage and
sharing of data about individuals.

This workshop will feature presentations by invited speakers, and short summary discussion.

### Abstracts

#### Governing large-scale data sharing through individual consent and privacy

[Kjetil Rommetveit](http://www.uib.no/en/persons/Kjetil.Rommetveit) –
Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities, University of Bergen.

Since the inception of the human genome project, systematic and institutional
efforts have been in place to regulate the collection, storage and processing of
health information for purposes of research and health care delivery. Such
efforts have always been subject to conflicting demands: on the one hand
responding to rapid technological innovation in fields such as bioinformatics
and ‘post-genomics’; on the other hand trying to anchor and legitimate such
innovations by recourse to the institutional demands of law and ethics. In this
talk I trace some main configurations of large-scale databanks with ethical and
legal efforts towards regulation: whereas initial approaches turned on
individual consent, the severe problems encountered by (individual) consent
resulted in a ‘communitarian turn’ in which collective interests seem to trump
individual rights of patients and research subjects. I argue that the bioethical
debate has been epistemologically and institutionally insufficient for dealing
with the problems, and I point to new developments in the EU General Data
Protection Regulation that could possibly remedy some of the shortcomings. Yet,
even as the new Regulation remains to be implemented, it seems clear that also
this effort will run into difficulties. Hence, more than anything, the
governance of large-scale databanks remains a protracted problem in need of
critical scrutiny and public debate.

#### Linking biobank data to multigenerational population data: Experiences from the POPLINK-project in Umeå

[Elisabeth Engberg](http://www.cedar.umu.se/english/about-cedar/staff/?uid=elen0001) –
Centre for Demographic and Aging Research, Umeå University.

POPLINK is a multigenerational population database constructed to overcome two
main obstacles which long has obstructed and delayed the effective use of the
unique Swedish registers for large-scale studies and multigenerational research:
a poor access to 20th century micro-data, before the 1950-60s when modern
registers were introduced, and a lacking coordination between population- and
research registers. The POPLINK database covers >20 selected parishes in
northern Sweden, where a large part of the population - up to 100 percent in
certain age groups - is previously included in prospective biobank cohorts.
Methods for secure linkage to biobank data and other civil registration based
registry resources have been drawn up, tested and evaluated in close cooperation
with Statistics Sweden. This presentation will discuss the ethical issues
involved when setting up this kind of infrastructure and the experiences from
disseminating data to researchers. It will also give some examples of projects
where population data has been linked to biobanks and research registers, to
study the interaction between different risk factors over long time periods as
well as intergenerational patterns of disease.

#### Biobanks for public good or private gains. The case of deCODE examined

[Einar Arnason](http://uni.hi.is/einararn/) –
Faculty of Life- and Environmental Sciences, University of Iceland.

Public goods and public interests are tied together. The public goods model
exemplified by the UK Biobank contrasts with the commercial model of the deCODE
Biobank in Iceland. I will examine the case of deCODE. I follow the trail of the
money from deCODE's founding (1996) through its bankruptcy (2009), re-emergence
under almost the same name and its acquisition by Amgen (2012). I will examine
deCODE's evolving business plan of biobanking and research plan from linkage
analysis and positional cloning, to genome wide association studies (GWAS), and
whole genome sequencing (WGS). I will discuss the shortcomings of commercial
biobanks as a model of the public interest. The deCODE method of consent raises
at least two ethical issues, first about imputed genotypes and second about
actionable and non-actionable incidental findings. I will focus on these consent
issues and the issue of fair compensation.  

#### Blurring boundaries in the Danish regulation and management of data sharing and new genetics

[Mette Hartlev](http://www.jur.ku.dk/medarbejdere/mettehartlev) -
Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen.

The Danish regulation of health data and biobanks, and the use of data and
tissue samples for various purposes (treatment, research, and quality control
and development), is to a large degree structured by categories and distinctions
such as treatment/research, public/private, “dry” data/tissue samples and
national/international. E.g., the relation between the researcher and the
research subject is considered to of a different kind than the doctor-patient
relationship, requiring somehow special concerns and regulation.  Similarly,
data management in the public sector is governed by principles, which differ
from those applying in the private sector. This presentation will explore how
NGS and personalized medicine challenges these distinctions and blur the
boundaries between established legal categories. It will also look into which
topics should be considered to establish a new, and robust, legal and ethical
infrastructure for data sharing in the future.
