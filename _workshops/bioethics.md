### Bioethics of databanks and datasharing

Nordic committee on bioethics â€“ workshop at the 2016 NeIC conference

New technologies enable the accumulation of genetic data, biometric data and
health records. Also, mass of data from biosensors of individuals or automatic
monitoring of patients are being generated. Finally, personal data from social
networks and online accounts are being gathered and mined by companies. The
proper handling, security and use of such data is important in the current age
of internet and information technologies. Still, the ethical questions and legal
rights concerning the storing and sharing of the data remain either unresolved
or unrecognized, by society, researchers and companies. Some key questions
include, how is privacy guaranteed, how are less minors and minorities
protected, what is proper data handling, who can be affected by improper
handling or data leaks and how? The issues also include informed consent of the
citizens, control of access to data in public institutions, the key ethical
principles and the need to ensure that all parties have their say in the
process. The challenge is to build safeguards that protects individuals but also
enable use of the data for society, research or business. This session is
organized to raise awareness about the ethical and legal issues in relation to
sensitive data storing and sharing, with focus on the Nordic countries.

This workshop will feature presentations by invited speakers, and short summary
discussion towards the end, similar as in the
[NeIC 2015 Bioethics Workshop](http://neic2015.nordforsk.org/display/NeIC2015/Bioethics).
