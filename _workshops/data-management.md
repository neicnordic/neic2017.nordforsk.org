## Data Management Birds-of-a-Feather

Innovations in microelectronics, sensor technologies and computer science have
enabled experiment designs which generate far more digital data at higher
granularity and at a much greater pace than ever foreseen. At the same time
datasets are increasingly being kept and made available, partly for
validatability in research, but also to allow new insights to be pried from the
old data using novel analysis methods which ever evolve into greater
sophistication.

With limited resources in storage and processing we are forced to prioritize.
What to keep? What to discard? How do we know? Who will be steward? For how long
do we keep it? In what format? How will we be sure we can read it back? How can
we assign persistent identifiers so we are sure we are actually reading back the
same thing?

In this Birds-of-a-Feather session we will discuss the challenges in Data
management that we are currently facing in Nordic research and e-infrastructure.

### Topics for discussion
