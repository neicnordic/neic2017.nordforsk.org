## Data Management of Health Data and Register-based Research as a Driver for Innovation

Data Management of Life Science uses a series of tools in constant
development to work on an increasing amount of for example large scale omics data and often the
research is concerned with sensitive personal data.

This workshop will be concerned with ideas of how to create a more effective
management of such data: This includes ideas from the NeIC project, Tryggve,
about how to deploy tools rather than moving data and it includes a series of
ideas about how to make register-based research a source of innovation for
health and prosperity.

**Format**:

The 2 x 45 minutes workshop consists of 3 talks from scientists from 3
different countries plus a panel discussion about how an intelligent approach to
health data from the Nordic countries may form an innovative node of the EOSC.
