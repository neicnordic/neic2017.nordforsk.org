## 3rd Nordic Data Services Workshop

The 3rd Nordic Data Services Workshop will focus on
services operated by the National e-Infrastructure Providers, National
Data Service providers, and other stakeholders involved in providing
data services for research data. We will try to answer questions on
which part of research data life cycle is covered by which service and
how, what are the future strategies and trends in Nordic countries,
exchange knowledge and experiences.  

The 3rd Nordic Data Services Workshop is open to all
interested participants. Classic conference style presentations and
eventual discussion will take place during the session.
