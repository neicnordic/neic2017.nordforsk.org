## Experiences with the Knights Landing Processor

This workshop will concern programming the Knights Landing accelerator,
based on findings in the [PRACE Knights Landing Best Practice Guide](http://www.prace-ri.eu/best-practice-guide-knights-landing-january-2017/).
which was published in January 2017. This guide was produced in an effort led by
Ole Saastad, who is also organizing this workshop.

This workshop will include a review of first hand experiences at University of
Oslo with KNL, as well as presentations of experiences at other sites.

In addition we'll organise a hands on session to let the workshop
participants have a hands on experience using Knights Landing, using two systems
installed in Oslo.

Discussion of the usability of Knights Landing as a HPC processor in
comparison with Skylake and other modern processors (AMD-ZEN, OpenPower,
ARM-64, SunWei etc). For what workloads will KNL be the best option?
