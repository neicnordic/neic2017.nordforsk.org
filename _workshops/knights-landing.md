Presentation of other sites' experiences. 

In addition we'll organise a hands on session to let the workshop
participants have a hands on experience using Knights Landing, using two systems 
installed in Oslo. 

Discussion of the usability of Knights Landing as a HPC processor in
comparison with Skylake and other modern processors (AMD-ZEN, OpenPower,
ARM-64, SunWei etc). For what workloads will KNL be the best option?
