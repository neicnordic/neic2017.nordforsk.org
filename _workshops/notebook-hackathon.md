## Hackathon for Notebooks in Training

Format: Hands-on Hackathon

Jupyter Notebooks and other similar interactive web-based tools have quickly
gained popularity. They provide convenient environment for light-weight
programming and for that purpose are ideal for tutorials, demonstrations and
training courses. Notebooks allows to combine documentation with live code,
making it easy to create interactive step-by-step exercises. In this workshop we
develop and adapt notebooks to fit your training needs and ideas. The notebook
environment is provided from CSCâ€™s cloud service and previous experience with
the technology is not strictly necessary.

The workshop is aimed at participants who give training, technical support for
training or are otherwise interested in hacking notebooks. Programming
experience will be useful, but the idea is to have different people working
together and sharing their skill-sets.
