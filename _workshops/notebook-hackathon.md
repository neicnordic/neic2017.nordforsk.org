### Hackathon for Notebooks in training

Format: Hands-on Hackathon

Jupyter Notebooks and other similar interactive web-based tools have quickly
gained popularity. They provide convenient environment for light-weight
programming and for that purpose are ideal for tutorials, demonstrations and
training courses. Notebooks allows to combine documentation with live code,
making it easy to create interactive step-by-step exercises. In this workshop we
develop and adapt notebooks to fit your training needs and ideas. The notebook
environment is provided from CSCâ€™s cloud service and previous experience with
the technology is not strictly necessary.
