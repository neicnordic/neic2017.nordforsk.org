## Community Engagement Challenges for Novel Digital Services and Competences

<!--Modern research requires novel digital services and competences that combine
software, tools, data and computing across different institutions and across
heterogeneous environments. This session will explore the experiences from
different community engagement set-ups and share best practice on how these
digital services are integrated into our respective research communities
alongside the needed competences. This session will present challenges from
research communities, research infrastructure providers and data service
providers in their respective missions to enhance the use and implementation of
novel digital services. The workshop will host a panel debate between the
workshop speakers and workshop attendances, in order to openly reflect upon
existing challenges and best practices to improve community and competence
integration across disciplines, institutions and countries.
-->

Novel digital services are not always domain specific – in fact our services and digital tools turn stronger and reach a wider audience when we start adjusting and integrating them across scientific disciplines. How can we change this great imbalance that exists among the usage of novel digital tools and services between the scientific domains? Can we base our tools and competence building on type of data instead of type of research?

How do we address this issue? Can natural scientists work with digital humanists and vice versa? Can silo-experts become interdisciplinary? How can cross-disciplinary integration be attractive to domain specific experts?

These are some of the issues that will be debated during this workshop. We will explore community engagement challenges and share best practices from different types of digital service and competence providers/enablers.

The workshop will round off with a panel debate amongst the presenters and audience discussing common ground and individual gain when it comes to community engagement across scientific disciplines.

The workshop will provide recommendations for future directions on how to implement novel digital services across scientific domains alongside building competences.
