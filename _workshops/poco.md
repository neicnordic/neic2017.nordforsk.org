## Community Engagement Challenges for Novel Digital Services and Competences

Modern research requires novel digital services and competences that combine
software, tools, data and computing across different institutions and across
heterogeneous environments. This session will explore the experiences from
different community engagement set-ups and share best practice on how these
digital services are integrated into our respective research communities
alongside the needed competences. This session will present challenges from
research communities, research infrastructure providers and data service
providers in their respective missions to enhance the use and implementation of
novel digital services. The workshop will host a panel debate between the
workshop speakers and workshop attendances, in order to openly reflect upon
existing challenges and best practices to improve community and competence
integration across disciplines, institutions and countries.
