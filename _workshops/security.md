## Offensive Security

Do you ever feel like Michael Douglas in Falling Down? Do you ever get
the urge to just rip all the badly written software apart? This
workshop is for you.

We will look at classes of vulnerabilities, how to find them, how to
exploit them, and how to trample the system under your feet. Also
boring stuff like "pen test without going to jail" and "report
vulnerabilities without getting sued".

There will be hands-on sessions.

Bring your laptops, preferably with with some unixoid operating system
(like Linux or OS X).
