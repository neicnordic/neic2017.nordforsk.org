## Sensitive Data Workshop

Current research on several fields is more and more depending on availability
of suitable data. Especially research that studies humans and human activity
often need data that contains information of individuals in various forms. Such
data is referred to as sensitive data. Notably in biomedical sciences this is a
pressing issue, but concerns also several other fields. The use of sensitive
data for research holds great promises for improving the health and well-being
of people, so there is large motivation to make also sensitive data available
for researchers. On the other hand, the privacy of individuals need to be
preserved and all legislation and regulations need to be followed. In practice
the research communities need advanced IT services that implement the
requirements of legislation, so that they can conduct their research.

In the Nordic countries the national nodes of the ELIXIR research
infrastructure are working together to solve bottlenecks in using sensitive
data for research across borders. Together with NeIC they have launched the
Tryggve project, that includes secure service providers from Finland, Sweden,
Norway and Denmark.

This workshop will contain presentations on various aspects relating to use of
sensitive data in research, including secure IT services and highlights of the
outcomes of the Nordic Tryggve project, ethical and legal issues regarding the
use of sensitive data, as well as researchers’ presentations on how the
research data is currently being managed in the research community. There will
be time reserved for discussion and questions & answers after the
presentations. The participants will gain more understanding on the conditions
of using sensitive data and on the solution that implement them.

Format: The workshop programme will feature presentations on the above
mentioned topics: secure IT services, related ethics and legal topics, user
stories, and technical topics.
A report on the current status of sensitive data topics in the Nordic countries
will be jointly prepared based on the workshop.
