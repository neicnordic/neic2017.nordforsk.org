## Slurm Workshop

Slurm has become a de-facto standard for the scientific computing sites in the
Nordics. Many sites have used Slurm for long time, many have switched recently.
But both kinds need from time to time an advice from somebody else, whether it
is how to patch Slurm sources to tune it best for you site, or how to create the
very first configuration file.

The workshop aims to bring many Slurm admins in the Nordics together, to share
the experience and exchange advice, ideas and expertise with each other. It will
mostly be a user-driven event, where every admin will have a possibility to
bring up to discussion their particular problem or interest. The goal of the
workshop is to strengthen our mastery of Slurm to deliver even better computing
experience for the Nordics.

**Format**: We expect to start with site presentations, followed by unconference
format to discuss things the participants want. We also expect that the people
coming to the workshop use Slurm on their sites and have at least the
understanding of how it works and how to configure the simplest Slurm instance.
No hands-on tutorial is planned, this is rather the place to exchange
experiences and ideas.
