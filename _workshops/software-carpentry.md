## Teaching Researchers Basic Skills for Computational Research: the Software Carpentry Model

More and more researchers, from more and more disciplines, need basic
computational skill to be able to effectively collect, process, report on, and
share their research data. For many students, these skills are not taught as
part of their undergraduate curriculum. This leads to a demand for postgraduate
training in the use of eInfrastructures and programming.

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and [Data
Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org), and more recently, [Library
Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/), have been offering researchers
training in "the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and
with less pain" globally. A  team of volunteer instructors organises hundreds
of workshops serving thousands of scientists globally on a yearly basis.

At the University of Oslo, in collaboration with the Science Library and USIT,
we have built, and are expanding, [a community of instructors offering regular
Carpentry workshops](http://uio.no/carpentry) on several essential skills (unix
shell, version control, python, R, SQL, Make, data management) attracting many
researchers from the Oslo area.

In this workshop, you will become acquainted with the 'Carpentry' model of
teaching, and experience first-hand how a workshop is being run. You will learn
about how lesson material is developed collectively, and how volunteers can
become certified instructors. You will learn how the Carpentry effort at the
University of Oslo is organised, and how you can initiate or promote/stimulate
such an effort at your home institution or in your area/country.

We aim to both bring Nordic Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry folks
together to initiate a network, as well as recruit others to become involved.
As a result, we aim to broaden the geographic areas in the Nordics that are
able to offer Carpentry workshops.

The workshop organiser is Lex Nederbragt. He is an experienced instructor, as
well as an instructor trainer, for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, as
well as the main driver of the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry effort at
the University of Oslo.

Who should participate:

* Anyone interested in finding out more about what Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are all about
* Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors from the NeIC countries
* Staff responsible for training researchers
* Staff responsible for personnel that provide such training
* Researchers and staff interested in providing Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry (style) training at their home institutions/in their area/country
* Researchers and staff interested in building a community of instructors at their home institutions/in their area/country
