#### About NeIC 2017

Building on the enthusiasm from the first two Nordic e-Infrastructure
Conferences in 2013 and 2015, we are happy to announce the next NeIC
Conference, to be hosted by NeIC and SNIC. Similar to the first two NeIC
conferences we aim to organise NeIC 2017 as a collaboration between CSC, DeIC,
NeIC, NORDUnet, RHnet, SNIC and UNINETT Sigma2.

#### Registration will open 2017-01-30

Please follow this page for upcoming information about workshops, sessions, invited speakers,
